# RNA-seq Differential Expression Analysis (GSE299180)

This project performs a differential gene expression analysis using RNA-seq count data from the GEO Series **GSE299180**. The goal is to identify genes that are differentially expressed between siNC (control) and siCTCF (treated) samples in HESC (human embryonic stem cells).

## üî¨ Tools & Packages

This analysis is performed in **R** using the following Bioconductor and CRAN packages:

- `edgeR`
- `limma`
- `Glimma`
- `org.Hs.eg.db`
- `org.Mm.eg.db`
- `biomaRt`
- `gplots`
- `RColorBrewer`
- `NMF`
- `BiasedUrn`

## üìÅ Data

Raw count data files (`*.txt`) are downloaded from GEO and merged by the gene column. Sample metadata is manually created to define experimental groups.

## üß™ Analysis Steps

1. **Import count data** and merge all files into one dataset.
2. **Create a sample info table** with experimental conditions.
3. **Create a `DGEList` object** and filter low-expressed genes.
4. **Normalize** count data using TMM normalization.
5. **Build a design matrix** to define the experimental setup.
6. **Apply voom transformation** to prepare for linear modeling.
7. **Fit a linear model** and compute contrasts between groups.
8. **Visualize results** with:
   - **MDS plot** using Glimma
   - **Volcano plot** for significance and fold change
   - **Heatmap** of the top 100 DEGs
9. **Output** the top 50 and top 100 differentially expressed genes.

## üìä Outputs

- MDS plot: `mds_GSE299180/` (generated by Glimma)
- Volcano plot with gene labels
- Heatmap of top 100 DEGs
- Table of top 50 DEGs based on adjusted p-value (FDR < 0.05)

## üìå Notes

- Gene annotation is done using both human and mouse databases (`org.Hs.eg.db`, `org.Mm.eg.db`) for compatibility.
- Make sure all required packages are installed before running the analysis.
